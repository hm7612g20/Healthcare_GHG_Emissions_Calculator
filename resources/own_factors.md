**File should be a .csv file in the following format:**

component, loc, year, unit, factor_kgCO2eq_unit, carbon_content

The columns should be filled as follows:
- component: name of the component emissions factor corresponds to
- loc: country where factors file corresponds to, or rer (Europe) or row (Rest of World)
- year: year factor corresponds to
- unit: unit of component
- factor_kg_CO2eq_unit: emissions factor (GWP100) per unit of component
- carbon_content: % of carbon in component
